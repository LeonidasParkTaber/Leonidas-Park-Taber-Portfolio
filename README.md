# Leonidas-Park-Taber-Portfolio

## I am an undeclared engineering student at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a strong interest in mechanical engineering.

I value simplicity in design and problem-solving; I like to find straightforward and elegant solutions to complex challenges. 

I have an interest in prototyping and understand that meaningful progress can only be achived by failing fast. 

### The following is a list of links to projects I have worked on

[Remote Controlled Planes](https://github.com/LeonidasParkTaber/RC-Planes)

[Parabolic Speaker / Microphone](https://github.com/LeonidasParkTaber/Parabolic-Microphone-Speaker)

TO ADD: 

Phys reaserch/conductive foam ball paper

DBF: Many Banner mechanisums and prototyping around that, Wing to fus mount

FRC: Experince mechanical design

Car that Drives on Walls: impellor design/itterations + chassis redesign + ongoing project
