I am an undeclared engineering student at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a strong interest in mechanical engineering. 


I value simplicity in design and problem-solving, and I believe that even complex challenges often have straightforward and elegant solutions.

I have an interest in rapid prototyping, and understand that meaningful progress is driven by iterative failure. 

I also recognize that clear communication is essential to successful engineering.
