**I am an undeclared engineering student at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a strong interest in mechanical engineering.**

I value simplicity in design and problem-solving, and I believe that even complex challenges often have straightforward and elegant solutions.

I have an interest in rapid prototyping, and understand that meaningful progress is driven by iterative failure. 

I practice clear communication, as I understands it's essential role in good engineering. 


### The following is a list of links to other projects I have worked on in the past.
