## I am an undeclared engineering student at the University of Washington, Seattle, with a strong interest in mechanical engineering.

I value simplicity in design and problem-solving; I like to find straightforward and elegant solutions to complex challenges. 

I have an interest in prototyping and understand that meaningful progress can only be achived by failing fast. 

### The following is a list of links to projects I have worked on.
